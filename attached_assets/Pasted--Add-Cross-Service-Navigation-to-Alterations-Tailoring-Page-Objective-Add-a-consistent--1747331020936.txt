### Add Cross-Service Navigation to "Alterations & Tailoring" Page

**Objective:**
Add a consistent “Explore Our Other Services” section to the `/all-services/alteration-tailoring` page. The section should match the layout, styling, and functionality used on the **Dry Cleaning** and **Wash & Fold** pages.

**Section Placement:**
Insert the new section **below the main Alterations & Tailoring content** and **above the "How It Works" section**.

---

**Content for the Section:**

* **Section Title:**
  `<h2>Explore Our Other Services</h2>`

* **Subtitle (optional):**
  `More ways we can help keep your wardrobe and home at their best`

---

**Services to Display (Exclude Alterations & Tailoring):**

1. Dry Cleaning
2. Wash & Fold
3. Wedding Gowns
4. Shoe Repair
5. Cleaning of Household Items
6. Delivery

Each card should include:

* A clean service icon
* Service name
* A short one-line description
* Link to the correct service page

---

**Design & Styling Guidelines:**

* Use a **responsive grid** layout:

  * Desktop: 3 cards per row
  * Tablet: 2 cards
  * Mobile: 1 card
* All boxes must be **equal size** in both width and height.
* Add **hover effects** (e.g., box shadow or slight scale-up).
* Match the site's current font, color scheme, and spacing.
* Example CSS:

  ```css
  .service-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
    gap: 2rem;
  }

  .service-card {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 1.5rem;
    background-color: #fff;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    height: 100%;
    min-height: 220px;
  }
  ```

---

**Routing for Each Card:**

* `/services/dry-cleaning`
* `/services/wash-fold`
* `/services/wedding-gowns`
* `/services/shoe-repair`
* `/services/household-items`
* `/services/delivery`

---

**Accessibility Notes:**

* Use semantic HTML: `<section>`, `<h2>`, `<nav>`, `<a>`
* Include `alt` tags or `aria-labels` for icons and links
