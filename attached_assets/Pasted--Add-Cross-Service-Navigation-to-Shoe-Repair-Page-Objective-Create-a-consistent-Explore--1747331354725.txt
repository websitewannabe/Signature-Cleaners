### Add Cross-Service Navigation to "Shoe Repair" Page

**Objective:**
Create a consistent “Explore Our Other Services” section on the `/all-services/shoe-repair` page, matching the design and behavior of similar sections already added to the **Dry Cleaning**, **Wash & Fold**, **Alterations & Tailoring**, and **Wedding Gown** pages.

---

**Section Placement:**
Insert this section **after the main Shoe Repair content** and **just before the “How It Works” section**.

---

**Section Content:**

* **Heading:**
  `<h2>Explore Our Other Services</h2>`

* **Subtitle (optional):**
  `More ways we can help keep your wardrobe and home at their best`

---

**Services to Display (Exclude Shoe Repair):**

1. Dry Cleaning
2. Wash & Fold
3. Alterations & Tailoring
4. Wedding Gowns
5. Cleaning of Household Items
6. Delivery

Each service should be presented as a **card** with:

* A representative icon
* The service name
* A one-line description
* A link to the corresponding service page

---

**Design & Layout Guidelines:**

* Use a **responsive grid layout**:

  * Desktop: 3 cards per row
  * Tablet: 2 cards
  * Mobile: 1 card
* **Uniform card sizing**:

  * All cards must have equal height and width, regardless of content
* **Interactive styling**:

  * Add a hover effect like `box-shadow` or `transform: scale(1.03)`
* Match existing site styles in terms of font, spacing, and color scheme

---

**Example CSS:**

```css
.service-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}

.service-card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 1.5rem;
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  height: 100%;
  min-height: 220px;
}
```

---

**Routing:**

Each card should link to:

* `/services/dry-cleaning`
* `/services/wash-fold`
* `/services/alterations-tailoring`
* `/services/wedding-gowns`
* `/services/household-items`
* `/services/delivery`

---

**Accessibility Notes:**

* Use semantic elements (`<section>`, `<nav>`, `<h2>`, `<a>`)
* Include `aria-labels` or `alt` attributes for icons and links
