## üìê What This Does

* **Z-pattern**: Alternates the layout direction using `md:flex-row-reverse` every other section.
* **Dynamic city name**: Automatically injects the city name from the `city` object.
* **Accessible & responsive**: Fully responsive layout with image and text pairing.
* **Preserves CTA styling**: Uses the same button and color scheme from your existing design.
