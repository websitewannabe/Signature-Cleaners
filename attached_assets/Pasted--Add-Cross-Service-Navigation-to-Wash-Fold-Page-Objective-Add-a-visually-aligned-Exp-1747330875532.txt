### Add Cross-Service Navigation to "Wash & Fold" Page

**Objective:**
Add a visually aligned **“Explore Our Other Services”** section to the bottom of the `/services/wash-fold` page, directly above the “How It Works” section — just like on the Dry Cleaning page.

**Key Requirements:**

1. **Section Title and Subtitle:**

   * Title: `<h2>Explore Our Other Services</h2>`
   * Subtitle: `More ways we can help keep your wardrobe and home at their best`

2. **Displayed Services (Exclude “Wash & Fold” itself):**

   * Dry Cleaning
   * Alterations & Tailoring
   * Wedding Gowns
   * Shoe Repair
   * Cleaning of Household Items
   * Delivery

3. **Design + Layout:**

   * Display each service as a card with:

     * An icon (consistent with the brand style).
     * Title of the service.
     * One-line description.
   * Use a **3-column responsive grid**:

     * Desktop: 3 cards/row
     * Tablet: 2 cards/row
     * Mobile: 1 card/row
   * Apply a uniform size to all cards (same **width and height** regardless of content).
   * Include hover effects like scale or subtle shadow.
   * Match the color scheme and typography of the rest of the Signature Cleaners site.

4. **CSS Guidance:**
   Example styling for equal height cards:

   ```css
   .service-grid {
     display: grid;
     grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
     gap: 2rem;
   }

   .service-card {
     display: flex;
     flex-direction: column;
     justify-content: space-between;
     align-items: center;
     padding: 1.5rem;
     background-color: #fff;
     border-radius: 10px;
     box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
     height: 100%;
     min-height: 220px;
   }
   ```

5. **Routing:**
   Each card should route to the appropriate service page:

   * `/services/dry-cleaning`
   * `/services/alterations-tailoring`
   * `/services/wedding-gowns`
   * `/services/shoe-repair`
   * `/services/household-items`
   * `/services/delivery`

6. **Accessibility:**

   * Add semantic HTML (`<section>`, `<nav>`, `<a>`)
   * Include `alt` or `aria-label` values for icons
