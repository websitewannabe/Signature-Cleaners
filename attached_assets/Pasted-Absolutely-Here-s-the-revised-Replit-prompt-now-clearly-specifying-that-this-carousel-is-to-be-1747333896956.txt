Absolutely! Here's the revised **Replit prompt**, now clearly specifying that this carousel is to be implemented **on the Dry Cleaning page**:

---

### üîÑ Replit Prompt: Add "Explore Our Other Services" Carousel to the Dry Cleaning Page

**Page:**
`/services/dry-cleaning`

**Objective:**
Replace the static ‚ÄúExplore Our Other Services‚Äù grid currently on the **Dry Cleaning page** with a **rotating, responsive carousel**. This carousel should highlight the other service offerings, each with its logo/icon and name, linking to the appropriate service page.

---

**Functionality & Design Requirements:**

1. **Carousel Content:**

   * Each item in the carousel must include:

     * The **service icon/logo**
     * The **name/title of the service** (e.g., "Wash & Fold")
     * A link to the respective service page
   * Do **not include "Dry Cleaning"** in the carousel, since the user is already on that page.

2. **Responsiveness:**

   * **Desktop:** 3 services visible at a time
   * **Tablet:** 2 services visible
   * **Mobile:** 1 service visible
   * Enable **touch/swipe support** for mobile devices

3. **Navigation Features:**

   * Include **left/right arrows**
   * Optional: **dot indicators** beneath the carousel
   * Auto-scroll every 4‚Äì6 seconds with smooth animation
   * User interaction (click/swipe) pauses auto-scrolling

4. **Accessibility:**

   * Use semantic HTML elements (`<section>`, `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<a>`)
   * Ensure all logos have `alt` text or `aria-label`s
   * Provide keyboard navigation for arrows

---

**Recommended Libraries:**

* **Swiper.js** (preferred) or **React Slick Carousel**
* Example install:

  ```bash
  npm install swiper
  ```
