### Add Cross-Service Navigation to "Wedding Gown" Page

**Objective:**
Add a visually consistent “Explore Our Other Services” section to the `/all-services/wedding-gown` page. This section should follow the same structure and style as used on the **Dry Cleaning**, **Wash & Fold**, and **Alterations & Tailoring** pages.

---

**Section Placement:**
Place this new section **beneath the main Wedding Gown content** and **just above the "How It Works" section**.

---

**Section Content:**

* **Title:**
  `<h2>Explore Our Other Services</h2>`

* **Subtitle (optional):**
  `More ways we can help keep your wardrobe and home at their best`

---

**Services to Feature (Exclude Wedding Gown):**

1. Dry Cleaning
2. Wash & Fold
3. Alterations & Tailoring
4. Shoe Repair
5. Cleaning of Household Items
6. Delivery

Each service card must include:

* An icon that fits the branding
* The name of the service
* A short descriptive line
* Link to its dedicated page

---

**Layout and Style:**

* **Responsive grid layout**:

  * Desktop: 3 columns
  * Tablet: 2 columns
  * Mobile: 1 column
* **Equal card size**:

  * All cards must maintain the same height and width
* **Hover effect**:

  * Light box-shadow or scale animation on hover
* Follow the existing site's font family, padding, and color scheme

---

**Example CSS:**

```css
.service-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}

.service-card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 1.5rem;
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  height: 100%;
  min-height: 220px;
}
```

---

**Routing for Each Service Card:**

* `/services/dry-cleaning`
* `/services/wash-fold`
* `/services/alterations-tailoring`
* `/services/shoe-repair`
* `/services/household-items`
* `/services/delivery`

---

**Accessibility Considerations:**

* Use semantic HTML: `<section>`, `<h2>`, `<a>`
* Add `alt` or `aria-label` attributes for all icons and links
