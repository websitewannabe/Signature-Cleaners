### Add Cross-Service Navigation to "Cleaning of Household Items" Page

**Objective:**
Add a consistent and responsive “Explore Our Other Services” section to the `/all-services/clean-household-items` page. This section should match the layout and design already used on the **Dry Cleaning**, **Wash & Fold**, **Alterations & Tailoring**, **Wedding Gown**, and **Shoe Repair** pages.

---

**Placement:**
Insert this section **below the main household items content** and **above the “How It Works” section**.

---

**Section Content:**

* **Title:**
  `<h2>Explore Our Other Services</h2>`

* **Subtitle (optional):**
  `More ways we can help keep your wardrobe and home at their best`

---

**Services to Include (Exclude Household Items):**

1. Dry Cleaning
2. Wash & Fold
3. Alterations & Tailoring
4. Wedding Gowns
5. Shoe Repair
6. Delivery

Each service card must contain:

* A relevant icon
* The service name
* A one-line description
* A link to its respective route

---

**Design Requirements:**

* Use a **responsive grid layout**:

  * Desktop: 3 cards per row
  * Tablet: 2 cards per row
  * Mobile: 1 card per row

* Ensure **uniform size** across all cards (equal height and width)

* **Styling tips:**

  * Consistent padding and margins
  * Hover effect (e.g. `transform: scale(1.03)` or `box-shadow`)
  * Color scheme and typography should match the existing website design

---

**Example CSS:**

```css
.service-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}

.service-card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 1.5rem;
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  height: 100%;
  min-height: 220px;
}
```

---

**Routing for Each Card:**

* `/services/dry-cleaning`
* `/services/wash-fold`
* `/services/alterations-tailoring`
* `/services/wedding-gowns`
* `/services/shoe-repair`
* `/services/delivery`

---

**Accessibility Notes:**

* Use semantic HTML tags (`<section>`, `<h2>`, `<a>`)
* Include appropriate `alt` attributes or `aria-labels` for icons and links
