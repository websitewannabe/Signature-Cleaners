Got it — here are the rewritten prompts using only dashes for structure and plain text for easy copy-paste.

**Prompt 2A: Rebuild the Header Layout Structure**

Rebuild the `header.tsx` file from scratch using a clean flex layout.

- The header should have three sections:
  - Left section: the logo
  - Center section: the main navigation
  - Right section: the account and contact links

- In the left section:
  - Add the Signature Cleaners logo
  - Make the logo link to "/"

- In the center section:
  - Add a Home icon that links to "/"
  - Add a SERVICES link that routes to "/services"
  - Add an ABOUT US link that routes to "/about"
  - For now, do not include the dropdown, just make the SERVICES link functional

- In the right section:
  - Add a CONTACT link that routes to "/contact"
  - Add a MY ACCOUNT link that routes to "/auth"

- Make sure the layout is done using Flexbox
- Each section should be spaced evenly and vertically centered
- Use Tailwind classes to match the existing header design including background transparency, scroll shadow, and blur

**Prompt 2B: Add Services Dropdown and Mobile Navigation**

Now build on the header layout created in the previous step by adding the dropdown menu and mobile nav.

- Add a hoverable dropdown to the SERVICES link
- The dropdown should include links to the following paths:
  - Delivery → "/delivery"
  - Alterations & Tailoring → "/alteration-tailoring"
  - Interior Cleaning → "/interior-cleaning"
  - Clean Household Items → "/clean-household-items"
  - Dry Cleaning → "/dry-cleaning"
  - Wedding Gowns → "/wedding-gown"
  - Suede & Leather Cleaning → "/suede-leather-cleaning"
  - Shoe Repair → "/shoe-repair"
  - Wash & Fold → "/services/wash-fold"
  - Folding Dress Shirt Services → "/services/folding-dress-shirt"

- Add a mobile navigation menu using the `Sheet` component
- The mobile menu should include all main links, in the same order as desktop
- Inside the mobile menu, place CONTACT before MY ACCOUNT
- The services dropdown items should be shown as regular links in the mobile view
- Make sure everything is responsive and styled like the rest of the site (dark background, white text, hover effects)

Let me know if you want these converted to JSX or Tailwind snippets too.
